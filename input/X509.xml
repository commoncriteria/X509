        <h:p>
        	X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) standard for public key certificates.
        	Public key certificates are used as authentication mechanisms for trusted communications protocols and as integrity verification methods.
      	</h:p><h:p>
		This <h:i>Functional Package (FP) for X.509</h:i> provides a collection of X.509 
      		Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and 
		Evaluation Activities (EAs) for the issuance, use, and validation of X.509 certificates. The intent 
		of this package is to provide Protection Profile (PP), collaborative Protection Profile (cPP), and Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) authors 
		with a readily consumable collection of SFRs and EAs to be integrated into
		their documents.

		<h:p>The TOE in this FP is the portion of product that provides X.509 capabilities to other portions of the TSF, such as 
			functions for subject authentication, 
			trusted communications, validation of TOE software/firmware updates, or integrity verification as part of self-testing. 
			At minimum, a conformant TOE will include the ability to validate X.509 certificates presented to it, including but not limited to:
			<h:ul>
				<h:li>cryptographic validity of the digital signature</h:li>
				<h:li>time-based validity</h:li>
				<h:li>issuer-based validity</h:li>
				<h:li>revocation status using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</h:li>
				<h:li>validation that the certificate's extensions are consistent with its intended use</h:li>
			</h:ul>A conformant TOE must also define its intended uses for X.509 certificates and how to proceed when a certificate with undetermined 
			revocation status is presented to it.
			</h:p><h:p>
			This FP also defines mechanisms by which the TSF can generate a certificate signing request (CRL) for receiving a signed certificate from a 
			certification authority (CA). This may be generated either as a file that is provided to a CA manually or done via an active network connection to the 
			CA using Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).
			</h:p><h:p>
			There may also be some situations where revocation checking is not performed. This FP defines an optional requirement for cases where exceptions
			to the claimed revocation functionality exist.
			</h:p><h:p>
			Lastly, the X.509 functionality defined by this FP is part of a TOE but is not considered to be an entire TOE on its own. X.509 functionality
			is implemented by a wide variety of technology products, some of which are standalone and some of which are dependent on a trusted platform
			(such as a software application on a general-purpose computer or mobile device). Auditable events have been defined for the SFRs in this FP for cases
			where the TOE boundary includes an audit function specified by FAU_GEN.1. A TOE that conforms to this FP may also implement or rely on its operational
			environment to implement appropriate management functionality for X.509 functionality that may include, but is not limited to:
			<h:ul>
				<h:li>Specifying root and intermediate CA certificates to be used as trust anchors.</h:li>
				<h:li>Generating certificate requests and loading signed certificates for the TOE's own use into its trust store.</h:li>
				<h:li>Specifying the revocation method that is used.</h:li>
				<h:li>Configuring how the TOE behaves in the event that certificate revocation information is unavailable.</h:li>
			</h:ul>
			Any conformant TOE must consider the extent to which X.509 functionality must be managed and ensure that appropriate management claims are made in 
			the TOE's Security Target or that the TOE conforms to a PP that allows a trusted platform in its operational environment to implement them.
			</h:p><h:p>
			This FP describes the extended security functionality of X.509 in terms of <xref g="CC"/>. </h:p>
		<h:p>The contents of this FP must be appropriately incorporated into a PP, cPP, or PP-Module. When this package 
		is so incorporated, the ST must include selection-based requirements in accordance with the selections or assignments 
		indicated in the incorporating document.
		</h:p><h:p>The PP, cPP, or PP-Module that instantiates this Package must typically include the following components in order to satisfy 
		dependencies of this Package. It is the responsibility of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module author who incorporates this FP to 
		ensure that dependence on these components is satisfied, either by the TOE or by assumptions about its OE.
		</h:p><h:p>An ST must identify the applicable version of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module, and of this
		FP in its conformance claims.</h:p>

				<aactivity>
					<TSS>
						<h:p>The evaluator shall ensure the TSS describes where the check of validity of the certificates takes place
							(both in terms of circumstances as well as whether the TSF or the TOE platform is responsible for certificate
							validation in each case) and that the TSS identifies the rules for certificate field checking. In any case
							where a certificate is used in an authentication step or for validating the integrity of trusted updates,
							it is expected that revocation checking will be performed. If X.509 certificates are used for power-on
							self-tests, it is not necessary to verify certificate revocation status in this situation.
						</h:p>
						
						<h:p>The TSS shall describe when revocation checking is performed and on what certificates. If the revocation
							checking during authentication is handled differently depending on whether a full certificate chain or only
							a leaf certificate is being presented, any differences must be summarized in the TSS and explained in the
							operational guidance.
						</h:p>
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						<h:p>
							The evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance describes where the check of validity of the
							certificates takes place and any of the rules for extendedKeyUsage fields.
						</h:p>
						
						<h:p>
							If the revocation checking method is configurable, the evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance describes
							how to specify the revocation checking method used, as well as any other implementation details for configuration of
							the revocation check function.
						</h:p>
					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						<h:p>
							The tests described must be performed in conjunction with the other certificate services evaluation
							activities, including the functions in <xref to="fia-x509-ext-2e1"/>. The tests for the extendedKeyUsage rules are
							performed in conjunction with the uses that require those rules. If the TSF supports chains of length four
							or greater, the evaluator shall create a chain of at least four certificates: the node certificate to be
							tested, two Intermediate CAs, and the root CA. If the TSF supports chains of length three, then only one
							intermediate CA shall be created. If the TSF supports a maximum chain of length two, then a chain with no
							Intermediate CA shall be created.
						</h:p>
						<testlist>
							<test> 
						<h:p>
							The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid certification path results
							in the function failing, for each of the following reasons, in turn:
						</h:p>
							<h:ul>
								<h:li>
									Establishing a certificate path in which one of the issuing certificates is not a CA certificate
								</h:li>
								<h:li>
									Omitting the basicConstraints field in one of the issuing certificates
								</h:li>
								<h:li>
									Setting the basicConstraints field in an issuing certificate to have CA=False
								</h:li>
								<h:li>
									Omitting the CA signing bit of the key usage field in an issuing certificate, and
								</h:li>
								<h:li>
									Setting the path length field of a valid CA field to a value strictly less than the certificate path
								</h:li>
							</h:ul>
						<h:p>
							The evaluator shall then establish a valid certificate path consisting of valid CA certificates, and
							demonstrate that the function succeeds. The evaluator shall then remove trust in one of the CA
							certificates, and show that the function fails.
						</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating an expired certificate results in the function failing.
								</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>The evaluator shall test that the TOE can properly handle revoked certificates, conditional on
								whether CRL, OCSP, OCSP Stapling or OCSP Multi-stapling is selected; if multiple methods are selected,
								then the following tests shall be performed for each method:
								<h:ul>
									<h:li>
										The evaluator shall test revocation of the node certificate.
									</h:li>
									<h:li>
										The evaluator shall also test revocation of an intermediate CA certificate (i.e., the intermediate
										CA certificate should be revoked by the root CA), if intermediate CA certificates are supported.
										If OCSP stapling per RFC 6066 is the only supported revocation method, this test is omitted.
									</h:li>
									<h:li>
										The evaluator shall ensure that a valid certificate is used and that the validation function succeeds. The
										evaluator then attempts the test with a certificate that has been revoked (for each method chosen in the selection)
										to ensure when the certificate is no longer valid that the validation function fails.
									</h:li>
								</h:ul>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									If any OCSP option is selected, the evaluator shall ensure the TSF has no other source of revocation
									information available and configure the OCSP server or use a man-in-the-middle tool to present an
									OCSP response signed by a certificate that does not have the OCSP signing purpose and which is the
									only source of revocation status information advertised by the CA issuing the certificate being
									validated. The evaluator shall verify that validation of the OCSP response fails and that the TOE
									treats the certificate being checked as invalid and rejects the connection. If CRL is selected, the
									evaluator shall likewise configure the CA to be the only source of revocation status information,
									and sign a CRL with a certificate that does not have the cRLsign key usage bit. The evaluator shall
									verify that validation of the CRL fails and that the TOE treats the certificate being checked as
									invalid and rejects the connection.
								</h:p>
								
								<h:p>
									Note: The intent of this test is to ensure a TOE does not trust invalid revocation status information.
									A TOE receiving invalid revocation status information from the only advertised certificate status
									provider should treat the certificate whose status is being checked as invalid. This should generally
									be treated differently from the case where the TSF is not able to establish a connection to check
									revocation status information, but it is acceptable that the TSF ignore any invalid information and
									attempt to find another source of revocation status (another advertised provider, a locally configured
									provider, or cached information) and treat this situation as not having a connection to a valid
									certificate status provider.
								</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									The evaluator shall modify any byte in the first eight bytes of the certificate and demonstrate that
									the certificate fails to validate (i.e., the certificate will fail to parse correctly).
								</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									The evaluator shall modify any byte in the last byte of the certificate and demonstrate that the
									certificate fails to validate (i.e., the signature on the certificate will not validate).	
								</h:p>
							</test>							
							<test>
								<h:p>
									The evaluator shall modify any byte in the public key of the certificate and demonstrate that the
									certificate fails to validate (i.e., the signature on the certificate will not validate).
								</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									(Conditional on support for EC certificates) The evaluator shall establish a valid, trusted
									certificate chain consisting of an EC leaf certificate, an EC Intermediate CA certificate not
									designated as a trust anchor, and an EC certificate designated as a trusted anchor, where the
									elliptic curve parameters are specified as a named curve. The evaluator shall confirm that the TOE
									validates the certificate chain.	
								</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									(Conditional on support for EC certificates) The evaluator shall replace the intermediate
									certificate in the certificate chain for the previous test with a modified certificate, where the
									modified intermediate CA has a public key information field where the EC parameters uses an explicit
									format version of the Elliptic Curve parameters in the public key information field of the
									intermediate CA certificate from Test 8a, and the modified Intermediate CA certificate is signed by
									the trusted EC root CA,  but having no other changes. The evaluator shall confirm the TOE treats the
									certificate as invalid.
								</h:p>
							</test>
							<test>
								<h:p>
									(conditional on support for EC certificates) The evaluator shall establish a subordinate CA
									certificate, where the elliptic curve parameters are specified as a named curve, that is signed by a
									trusted EC root CA. The evaluator shall attempt to load the certificate into the trust store and
									observe that it is accepted into the TOE's trust store. The evaluator shall then establish a
									subordinate CA certificate that uses an explicit format version of the elliptic curve parameters,
									and that is signed by a trusted EC root CA. The evaluator shall attempt to load the certificate into
									the trust store and observe that it is rejected, and not added to the TOE's trust store.
